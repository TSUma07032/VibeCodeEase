## 2024-08-10 - [Medium] Fix CSP Nonce predictability
**Vulnerability:** The Webview used `Math.random()` to generate the CSP nonce.
**Learning:** `Math.random()` generates pseudo-random numbers which are predictable. If an attacker can predict the sequence, they can guess the nonce and bypass the Content-Security-Policy (CSP), potentially executing arbitrary XSS payloads in the context of the VS Code extension's Webview.
**Prevention:** Always use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNG), such as Node.js's `crypto.randomBytes()`, for security-critical values like nonces, tokens, and passwords.
